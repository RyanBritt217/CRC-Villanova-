# Common Research Configuration Wing Desing Improvment

**Problem Statement:**

At present, the design of the wings is well-established, however, there are some areas where improvements may be realized. The manufacturing process varies depending on the CRC weight class and available equipment. This leads to some challenges in the design, manufacturing and assembly. In the past, ARL has utilized manual and automated foam cutting processes, balsa spar and monokote assemblies, and carbon fiber layup as wing manufacturing methods. Each of these methods have both positive and negative aspects, when considered in terms of difficulty, precision, mass, and stiffness. For example, foam wings can offer very low mass, but have a fragile trailing edge that is easily damaged. Balsa spar and monokote wings offer excellent performance in terms of mass and lightweight, but are quite challenging to build as they require substantial skill by the builder.

Another area that could use improvement is the wing mounting design. As with the wing itself, the mounting solution varies based on the CRC weight class, who has designed the platform, when it was built, and what equipment was available. Current methods are either difficult to assemble and disassemble, lack crash-worthiness, or are too heavy.

**Project Objectives:**

ARL seeks a systematic study of the wing design, manufacturing, and mounting that trades off aspects of mass, crash-worthiness, stiffness, precision, ease of manufacture and assembly, and potential for future adaptation to include moving control surfaces (elevators, elevons, ailerons, etc).

Some possible manufacturing methods to explore include:

- 3D printing using lightweight methods and materials like lightweight PLA
- Foam plus reinforcements
- Spar and coating methods
- Jig-based construction methods that ease builder skill requirements
- Hybrid methods that combine beneficial aspects of other traditional methods

Some wing mounting methods to explore include:

- Magnetic fastening with tuned breakaway force for enhanced crash survivability
- Hook and loop fasteners
- Other lightweight, easy to use, or otherwise beneficial methods yet to be envisioned

The criteria for evaluation of each design should include:

- manufacturing precision
- level of builder skill and specialized equipment required
- overall wing mass
- wing stiffness in bending and torsion
- ease of assembly and disassembly
- envisioned crash worthiness (or possibly experimentally tested crash worthiness if a suitable test scenario can be developed)
- Additional criteria that will be discussed during the project execution by the team and the POC at ARL
